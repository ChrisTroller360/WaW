# WaW
WaW is a multi-functional program that relies on media databases. In WaW, a user can view information about the movie/game(anticipated functionality)/book(anticipated functionality) that they are currently enjoying or hope to enjoy. The program functions not only as a query tool, however, as it also allows lists of films to be made and kept.
